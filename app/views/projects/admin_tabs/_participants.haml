    -# The HTML for the participants UI is dynamically created client side using JSON.
    -# The client code uses the initialParticipants element to initially populate the list,
    -# which prevents us from either:
    -#   (1) havmaking the server try to render the same HTML as the script, or
    -#   (2) forcing an API call every time the page loads.

    -# This element gets wiped out as soon as the page is gone, preventing stale initial data
    -# from wiping out newer, better data.
